## Platform Overview

Wenxin Large Model is a finance-domain large language model developed by Huabo Cloud (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. in collaboration with the technical team of Harbin Institute of Technology. Focused on the "finance brain", it deeply integrates finance-domain knowledge with reasoning and decision-making capabilities, empowering AI to directly solve enterprise problems.

The platform provides three working modes and five engines; the finance capabilities of Wenxin Large Model form the four intelligence capabilities. The model and the five engines together constitute the Enterprise AI Ontology, from which ten applications covering the entire finance chain grow. Applications are built on AI capabilities and can iterate and adjust quickly with business needs.

**Three Working Modes**

- **Menu-based** — use applications through function menus, ready out of the box
- **Skill-based** — encapsulate large-model capabilities as composable skills, orchestrated per scenario
- **Conversational** — talk to the large model to perform business operations directly; AI solves problems directly

**Four Intelligence Capabilities**

- **AI Office** — the conversational working capability of the large model, turning daily office tasks into natural language
- **AI Consulting** — management-consulting capability; finance expert knowledge is distilled into intelligent Q&A
- **AI Modeling** — dynamic modeling capability; indicators, rules and risk models are built dynamically with the business
- **AI Coding** — application generation capability; dynamic modeling, real-time coding, delivery anytime

The four intelligence capabilities run on top of the Enterprise AI Ontology and act on the enterprise's business objects and rules, forming a value loop from model capability to business execution.

**Wenxin Agents**

The Wenxin Agent is the running unit that carries the four intelligence capabilities and executes business: on the Agent Platform, model capabilities, knowledge bases, tools and business processes are orchestrated together, applied to the Enterprise AI Ontology and distributed to business modules for use — covering the whole flow from building to using.

- **Build** — create applications on the Agent Platform (conversational or workflow type), visually orchestrate workflow nodes (LLM calls, knowledge retrieval, conditional branches, template conversion, code execution, tool calls, etc.), write prompts and configure model parameters; attach knowledge bases (upload enterprise policies and business documents for retrieval augmentation) and tool plugins, so agents acquire enterprise knowledge and business capabilities
- **Debug & Publish** — validate results through conversation debugging; publish applications upon confirmation and automatically obtain an API key; supports dual-track operation of draft debugging and published running
- **Authorize & Distribute** — in System Settings → Agent Management, distribute and authorize agents to business modules and members, controlling who can use what, and where
- **Use** — business users invoke agents through the AI assistant inside business modules, raising business requests via conversation; the agent understands and executes the corresponding business operations; direct business access via conversation is also supported
- **Audit Trail** — conversation history and running records are retained for review, supporting continuous agent optimization

**Five Engines**

Organization Engine · Role Engine · Process Engine · Form Engine · Rule Engine — the operational foundation that brings the large model into enterprise operation.

**Enterprise AI Ontology**

The Enterprise AI Ontology is the enterprise's digital twin and operating layer: it models the enterprise's organizational structure, business objects, relationships and control rules into a standardized knowledge system. Its foundation consists of three parts — enterprise-specific development templates constrain AI behavior norms, MCP tool integration connects enterprise knowledge and norms, and skill authorization defines capability boundaries and execution approvals. Wenxin Large Model runs on top of the ontology, becoming an AI that understands the enterprise's own structure, norms and business, continuously operating, learning and executing business within the enterprise.

**Platform Architecture**

Wenxin Large Model is structured in four layers from top to bottom: the large-model foundation, the five engines, the Enterprise AI Ontology, and the applications of the four intelligence capabilities. The large-model foundation provides finance-domain understanding, reasoning and decision-making; the five engines — organization, role, process, form and rule — model enterprise operating elements into a standardized knowledge system; together they constitute the Enterprise AI Ontology — the enterprise's digital twin and operating layer, accumulating business objects, relationships and control rules. The four intelligence capabilities run on top of the ontology, growing applications that cover the entire business chain of enterprise supervision and operation.

# Management Accounting Powered by Wenxin Large Model

Management Accounting takes comprehensive budgeting as the main line, four parallel ledgers as the foundation, and performance management as the anchor, supported by shared services and business analysis to back management decisions.

![Management Accounting built with Wenxin Large Model](images/06-guanlikuaiji.png)

## Feature Composition

### Comprehensive Budgeting

- **Preparation**: task management, data entry, approval flows, adjustment, versions, templates and rules;
- **Control**: execution monitoring, alerts, alarms, limits, quotas and freezing;
- **Analysis**: variance, trends, rolling forecasts, scenario simulation and budget reports;
- Advanced capabilities such as intelligent recommendation, budget simulation, data mining and collaborative preparation are layered on top; the budget system is built level by level along the group organization, with organization structure, dimensions, indicators, models, permissions and audit trails.

### Four Ledgers

Four parallel ledgers — management, supervision, capital and control — each with independent statement data, ledger data, chart of accounts, balance sheets, general ledgers, detail ledgers and voucher libraries: business management, regulatory reporting, capital operations and group control each get what they need with mutually independent calibers.

### Performance Management

Goal management aligns with business objectives; appraisal schemes combine quantitative and qualitative measures; 360-degree evaluation aggregates multi-party feedback; performance interviews and calibration keep standards consistent; incentive management links to appraisal results — a complete closed loop from goals to incentives.

### Shared Services

The service portal receives requests in a unified way; intelligent review validates documents automatically; cost allocation executes automatically by rules; digital workers take on repetitive tasks; quality control samples and evaluates; job scheduling assigns tasks by rules.

### Archive Services

Archives are filed by category and year; AI-based classification sorts automatically; version management preserves revision history; archive permissions control browsing scope.

### Business Analysis

Five thematic analyses — profit, revenue, costs & expenses, assets & liabilities, receivables & payables — with multi-period and multi-organization comparison, presenting trends and structure together for management to assess business conditions.

## Business Process

At the start of the year, business goals are set and the comprehensive budget is prepared (task assignment, entry, approval, level-by-level decomposition) — during execution, budget control (monitoring, occupation, alerts, freezing) — at period end, budget analysis (variance, trends, rolling forecasts, scenario simulation); daily accounting runs in parallel across the four ledgers under different calibers; in appraisal season, performance management starts (goal comparison, appraisal schemes, 360-degree evaluation, calibration, results applied to incentives); insights from business analysis feed next year's goals and budgets, forming the annual management cycle.

## Business Value

Management Accounting systematizes the management loop of budget leadership, accounting support and performance appraisal: budgeting runs online from preparation to control to analysis with intelligent recommendation and simulation; the four ledgers account under multiple calibers; performance carries strategic goals; shared services and digital workers boost efficiency; business analysis moves finance from bookkeeping to decision support.
